<h3 class="BestWorksHeader"> ABOUT ME</h3>
<br>
<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  My name is Akhil Emmanuel, and I am a undergraduate engineering student attending&nbsp<a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</em></a>&nbspin Troy, NY. I am also an aviation enthusiast and licensed private pilot, with over 100 hours and 250 landings in real life and thousands more in various flight simulators.
</p>



<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  Additionally, I have a passion for expressing my creativity through filmmaking.  I volunteered at a local county TV station, <a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org" target="_blank"> <em>Montgomery Community Media (MCM)</em></a>, which along with other media classes I took in middle school gave me the skills and knowledge to make proper videos.
  At MCM I would work behind the scenes in various technical roles, such as the audio board, the teleprompter, the switcher, producer, or the floor director for multiple TV shows. 
  I also produced a pilot episode of my show, <em>DC Tech Zone</em> where I interviewed a technology entrepreneur who came out of the intelligence, military and defense community to highlight the fact that ex-military and intelligence people are capable of starting successful technology companies. 
</p>




<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  I also enjoy computer science and programming and have made this website from the ground up.
