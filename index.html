<h3 class="BestWorksHeader"> ABOUT ME</h3>
<br>
<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  My name is Akhil Emmanuel, and I am a undergraduate engineering student attending&nbsp<a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</em></a>&nbspin Troy, NY. I am also an aviation enthusiast and licensed private pilot, with over 100 hours and 250 landings in real life and thousands more in various flight simulators.
</p>

<p class="aboutMeDescription">
   <a href="https://infiniteflight.com/" target="_blank"><em>Infinite Flight</em></a>&nbspwas the first flight simulator that introduced me to the world of aviation. It's currently the most comprehensive flight simulator experience on mobile devices, allowing pilots to fly in real weather conditions, multiplayer across three servers, global scenery and in 61 realistic aircraft. 
   Infinite Flight also includes an <em>Expert Server</em> requiring pilots to acquire 50 hours of flight time and 100 landings. I'm part of the official <em>Infinite Flight Air Traffic Controllers (IFATC)</em>, the group of about 500 users allowed to control on the <em>Expert Server</em>. I had to pass both a written and practical test to join the IFATC team.
</p>

<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  Additionally, I have a passion for expressing my creativity through filmmaking.  I volunteered at a local county TV station, <a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org" target="_blank"> <em>Montgomery Community Media (MCM)</em></a>, which along with other media classes I took in middle school gave me the skills and knowledge to make proper videos.
  At MCM I would work behind the scenes in various technical roles, such as the audio board, the teleprompter, the switcher, producer, or the floor director for multiple TV shows. 
  I also produced a pilot episode of my show, <em>DC Tech Zone</em> where I interviewed a technology entrepreneur who came out of the intelligence, military and defense community to highlight the fact that ex-military and intelligence people are capable of starting successful technology companies. 
</p>




<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  I also enjoy computer science and programming and have made this website from the ground up.
